## AGL Above Ground Level
## AMSL Above Mean Sea Level
## ATC Air Traffic Control
The objectives of Air Traffic Control (ATC) services do not explicitly include prevention of collision
with terrain. Flight crew therefore retain the responsibility to ensure that all clearances issued by
ATC are safe in respect of terrain and obstacle clearance. Take into account non ISA conditions
and the terrain and weather conditions associated with the flight in making this determination. If in
any doubt, double check clearances with ATC.

## MSA Minimum Sector Altitude
MSA (Minimum Sector Altitude) represents the safe altitude around a navigation station or
aerodrome reference point. If no other information is present, the radius is 25 NM and may be valid
for a specific sector or approach runway. In case of an RNP approach, MSA may be replaced by a
Terminal Arrival Altitude (TAA) based on one of the procedure Þxes. The borders of each sector are
divided by bearings in regard to the originating point of the arc. MSAs and TAAs are used for
airport navigation and provide 1000 ft obstacle clearance down to the intermediate approach
segment. MSA and TAA sectors and values are oûcially published by State authorities.
